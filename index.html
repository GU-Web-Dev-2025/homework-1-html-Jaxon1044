        <!-- summary paragraph -->
        <p>Attention arts and crafts enthusiasts! If you've ever needed a prop, costume, 
        or setpiece built entirely from cardboard, then look no further! My name is Jaxon, A.K.A.
        the one and only <strong>Cardsmith</strong>, and i'm here to solve all your cardboard-crafting needs.</p>

        <p>As a cardsmith, I pride myself on being able to create virtually anything from cardboard, built to the
        highest levels of quality in both durability and style, all while keeping customer costs at an all time low
        through creative sourcing of free materials.</p>

        <p>I firmly believe that there's no project to big or small that cardboard can't solve. Far too often other
        craft outlets prioritize the selling of overpriced, environmentally-damaging supplies to passionate artists
        who have visions for great things, but not enough funds to fulfill them. Work with me, and I promise that
        I'll give 110% of my effort to making sure your creative goals are achieved.</p>

        <!-- Includes an unordered list of your core skills -->
        <p>Here are a few of my card-smithing skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Professional sketchwork and drawing skills for mockups and designwork</li>
            <li>Proficiency with 3D modeling software including Blender and Tinkercad</li>
            <li>Experience with assorted powertools and other construction tools./li>
            <li>Basic project management and leadership skills</li>
        </ul>
